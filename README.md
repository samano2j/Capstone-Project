# Capstone-Project

## TheraComm
TheraComm is an iOS-based mobile application that incorporates the core features of an email system and a chat system. â€‹Thus, allowing the patient to not only communicate with the therapist without having to meet up face-to-face, but also have the communication in real time.

## Project Scope
The scope of the project is to create an iOS-based application which will include the core features of an email system and a chat system. The following are the requirements for this project.

### Email Messaging Requirements
* Present user with a login prompt (user/password)
* Using the combination above, obtain valid API token.
* Show list of messages to the client. Each message in the listing would have: subject, from/to fields, portion of the message body, urgent/system label (if applicable).
* View particular message: Show all of the above in addition to the full body of the message.
* Navigate between folders (Inbox, Sent, Drafts).
* Save a draft message
* Update draft message
* Send a message (new or one that was drafted earlier)
* Delete a message
* Display any broadcast messages
* Ability to dismiss broadcast messages (if dismiss-able ).
* In general, application needs to handle errors appropriately when requests were not successful.

### Chat Messaging Requirements
* Send Message
* Delete Message
* Chat History
* Typing Indicator
* Enable one-to-one conversation
* Encrypted traffic
* View Chat List
* Push Notifications
* Display if user is online/offline

### Mental Health In Post-Secondary School System
Depression and anxiety are common and disabling disorders in post-secondary students in Saskatchewan, with higher prevalence rates than in the general adult population. Some students seek treatment, but many do not for various reasons including limited time, concerns about privacy and stigmatization, and preference to self-manage symptoms. Students who do seek services at post-secondary institutions in Saskatchewan often face long waiting lists or may only receive a limited number of sessions. Access to cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), which is known to be effective for depression and anxiety, is especially limited in this population, as high demand and constrained resources often only allow for a few sessions per student.

### Transdiagnostic internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT)
Transdiagnostic internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) is potentially a convenient method for students to access care for depression and anxiety. In transdiagnostic ICBT, clients receive access to the same information and skills as traditional face-to-face CBT as online lessons. Depression and anxiety are both targeted in transdiagnostic ICBT which helps to ensure multiple concerns are addressed in an efficient manner. This is important given that depression and anxiety are often comorbid. Research shows that transdiagnostic ICBT is effective at reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, and there is also evidence that the findings of research trials translate into clinical settings. Most commonly, ICBT is delivered with brief weekly therapist assistance (~20 minutes) via the telephone or secure email. 

### The WellBeing Course
Recently, a transdiagnostic ICBT program for depression and anxiety (the Wellbeing Course) was tailored specifically to post-secondary students (the UniWellbeing Course). The UniWellbeing Course has now been offered to over 800 students. In its current format, the UniWellbeing Course consists of 4 core lessons with the first three lessons having homework assignments. Students also have access to case stories and additional resources as needed (e.g., resources related . In order to facilitate treatment completion, students receive automated emails and have brief weekly contact with a clinician via email or phone. Results are highly encouraging, with 63% of students completing the full course, 11% 3 out of 4 lessons, 13% 2 lessons and 13% 1 lesson. Significant improvements in anxiety and depression have been found along with high levels of satisfaction with the course. It has been identified that prior to treatment, it is critical for students to be introduced to the course, comfortable with the treatment approach, and willing to practice and develop skills. 

While the above results are encouraging, feedback from clients suggests that the application used to deliver ICBT could be improved to better engage clients by providing a better user interface. The capstone project is about providing an iOS application for providing better communication between the clients and their therapist.
