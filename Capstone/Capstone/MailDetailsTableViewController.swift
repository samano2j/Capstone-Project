Students also have access to case stories and additional resources as needed (e.g., resources related . In order to facilitate treatment completion, students receive automated emails and have brief weekly contact with a clinician via email or phone. Results are highly encouraging, with 63% of students completing the full course, 11% 3 out of 4 lessons, 13% 2 lessons and 13% 1 lesson. Significant improvements in anxiety and depression have been found along with high levels of satisfaction with the course. It has been identified that prior to treatment, it is critical for students to be introduced to the course, comfortable with the treatment approach, and willing to practice and develop skills.Recently, a transdiagnostic ICBT program for depression and anxiety (the Wellbeing Course) was tailored specifically to post-secondary students (the UniWellbeing Course).
